# Detecting-Hate-Speech-NN-keras

After working on detecting hate speech using Naive Bayes Algorithm, I thought trying to classify the same using Neural Networks - Sequential model of keras to see if it can increase the accuracy of the classification.

But what I found is the accuracy almost remains the same using Neural Networks too. So, I think we need to work on the features used for the classification to improve our accuracy of the classification. Will try doing that as next part of exercises.
